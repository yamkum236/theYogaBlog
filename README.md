I created a fully responsive website to document all my findings and research about Yoga which is a personal interest of mine. This website uses HTML, CSS, Responsive Web Design and JavaScript. 

This was a fun project to take on as I learnt so much about how to build a website from scratch using the programming languages. I will continue frurther to learn more about them when creating better websites in the future!
