# theYogaBlog ðŸ§˜
I created a fully responsive website to document all my findings and research about Yoga which is a personal interest of mine. This website uses HTML, CSS, Responsive Web Design and JavaScript. 

This was a fun project to take on as I learnt so much about how to build a website from scratch using the programming languages. I will further continue to develop my skills and learn more when creating better websites in the future!

### [Contact Tab]
Using the HTML <a> tag I linked the contact page to where the contact button is located. 
Therefore when clicked, the website will show the contact button at the end of the page.

### [Learn Tab]
When the Learn tab is clicked on, it will automatically take the user to find local yoga classes avaliable near them.
